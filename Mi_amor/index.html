        <h3>To my amazing boyfriend ‚ù§Ô∏è</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I would need a thesaurus and a dictionary and William Shakespeare's artistic writing
            skills to explain to you how much I love you. You have been a significant part of my life.
            Our love story needs to be in the books and read by our children and that
            is why I am putting it on the web. Even my mother, MamaDugu, is inlove with you... lol.
            Your pretty smile, your perfectly shaped eyes, your beautiful teeth.... every single thing about you screams perfection.
            My own brilla. I love you Governor.
   
        </p>
        
        <p>But sometimes you make me want to hit you: Every single day 
            you find a way to make me angry. It is either you intentionally do something 
            you genuinely know I won't like, or you ignore me the entire day. Then 
            I'll plan a nice date for us, and you'll just ruin it by not showing up.
        </p>

        <p>I'm not going to roast you today. I'll do it some other time.</p>

        <p><em>I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, MR MBAWINI</em>. I really do. I am glad you never gave up on us. 
            I am glad you always put in efforts to make me happy. Thank you for coping with my frequent mood swings.
            Thank you for always showing up for me. I know you are that one person that I can always count on.
            You are such an amazing person.
        </p>

        <h4>You are so sweet</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Do you remember when we first met at Darkens and you offered to carry my bucket of water for me? 
            And then when you bought me bofrot even though I didn't ask for it? And you spent every day helping me solve SAT math questions
            because I was so dumb? And those times you bought me food because I didn't have money?
        </p>
        <p><i>**tears stream down my face**</i></p>
        <p>And when you slept in my room with me so I didn't have to sleep alone in the dark? And when you would
            take me out for a walk anytime I was sad? Or those times that you would rizz me up to make me happy?
            Yes! You are a very sweet boy, and I am glad I fell in love with you.
